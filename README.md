# 462_final_report


In the dataProcess File, there are 2 part, import and analysis.

Since initially the project is based on the sample (265M), which is not allowed to upload, I only import the small one and plot some graphs for data distribution.

While the analysis part is based on some files(csv formate) in .\output, 
they are the output from replay process with those big sample(265M). It costs 9 hours to generate data, instead I choose csv to Reproduce this experiment.

In the replay file,
it simulate the random, A/B Test, \epsilon-greedy, UCB and Thompson sampling algorithm for MAB problem.
